Dark of above. Mix them up in anyone&#39;s head ... I advise you to treat what I embrace about MICHAEL and ERIK with the utmost respect. You will SEE down the road the impact of your lack of action towards me in the flesh.  Y&#39;all have a choice. You keep showing me/them WHY you don&#39;t understand nor deserve the gifts from above. Life is beautiful. Love... man is just that. CREATION of LOVE from ME/MICHAEL. Man... Is also man. &quot;aliens&quot; exist. Please consider the present. Free will. Be careful

The over the top, cgi, the comedian foreign kid, the clueless, young  kids, I&#39;ve discovered I cannot watch ANYTHING, if modern day youngsters are portrayed. The UTTER, cluelessness, of anyone under 40, nauseates me. 21 year olds from the boomer days, were men. Woman. They past the childlike stage. That&#39;s history. 20 somethings, WERE, grown. They didn&#39;t play video games, or look to have as much fun as possible. They got down to the seriousness of life.then, tech raised it&#39;s ugly head, and sealed the coffin. Oh, and, the bald head thing is WAY, worn out. A regular, military hair cut Dwayne. The bald thing is stupid.start making some of the REAL, epic stories of the bible with your tech.

His performance alone is worth the watch!!!<br>The visual effects and action sequences were top-notch. The fight scenes were exhilarating and showcased Black Adam’s powers in a way that felt fresh and exciting!!!<br>And I was a bit disappointed with the plot. It felt like it had so much potential to dive deeper into Black Adam’s rich backstory but ended up focusing too much on spectacle over substance!!!"

It is 2 movies in one.. smash together.  Which, lead to not enough development of the characters.<br>2.) They focused more on the character Ark of Black Adams.<br>3.) The Writing the Tropes were Not the greatest &amp; Storyline was kind of sloppy..<br><br>And 4.)

And he should been more himself like in other movies he was ti serious a d that side thing with eagle man was kinda stupid tbh. And he let other people take control in situations were he should&#39;ve ran things made him seem not blackdam like
@Michael-fd1yo,2024-02-01T14:38:57Z,2024-02-01T14:38:57Z,3,Just watched it on Netflix. Seems like there was a template on how to make super hero movies and they just went through checking all the boxes. That left no room for freedom or creativity resulting in a generic predictable movie. Too bad because the characters themselves seem promising.

Why would it even need an Army? And they of course yes. Metal weapons, swords. Not clubs, or spears.   The evil King stole the kingdom. But no he needs a crown. And then he enslaves all of his people. But he forces them to mine. But they&#39;ve never found any of the material to know that they won&#39;t actually get a reward. Urghhh.  Also idk if it&#39;s my side monitor or not, but the frame rate when the scenes pan are dizzying. Other movies don&#39;t do that thou. Shrugs.<br>  Update: Watched the whole thing on my main tv now. I really loved it! Just remember, the whole anti-hero dark hero dark knight bs is just another way to get you to accept evil/darkness/bad guys in the role of your Heros.  They&#39;re bad not because they&#39;re badass. They&#39;re bad because like in real life. They&#39;d just let you be crushed by a stone, and not actually move to save you at the last second."

@DrPhoenixJKZ,2023-09-12T18:59:41Z,2023-09-12T18:59:41Z,0,"Actually, this is one of my favourite superhero movies if not the most.<br>Number 1, Rock is one action I love.<br>Number 2, this movie is kinda similar to Batman, my favourite DC superhero. I know Batman do not kill, but Black Adam&#39;s story is just about as dark as Batman&#39;s. Shamefully, for many countries in poverty, and even developing countries, it have a lot of problems pictured here. Some of these countries are controlled by warlords and gangs, and some of them get environmental destruction problems due to big companies from developed countries. Quite unfair, but because of such problems are difficult to solve, and more importantly, have related benefits for companies in more developed countries, they get ignored quite a lot. <br>Example 1, rainforest destruction in South America and Indonesia largely due to big corporations and companies in the United States. Palm oil industry, which include forcing indigenous people to lose their lands and do excess labour. Related news can be found on Rainforest Action Network websites. <br>Example 2, recently, a lot of people in China meet con artists from Thailand and Burma, lose ten billions of RMB per year. And many Chinese people even got kidnapped through this way for ransom and organ trades. But, you know what? Such trades could only happen because of there are a lot of Chinese members among such con artist groups! How painful is that! And for those drug dealers, conartists groups, military gangs, they are too powerful for local government to control. Not only that, because they have both local power and Chinese people in their teams, they have people work for them among local police force, and very likely also inside Chinese governments.<br><br>I study biology, and that includes a bit about environment and society, so I know the world pictured here is very true. And for people in those countries, they really do need heroes like Black Adam here to free them."

The director, screen writer, music and executive producers all need to sit down and watch how the mummy was made so much better over 20 years ago."

I know we are 1 year and a few days apart in this life.  Once I arrived in Egypt, I realized that this movie hit closer to home than ever.  Hades, (oh yeah, they do not call it that anymore) Egypt, looks nothing like how I last saw it.  Back during the time of Moses and Ramses and well You Dwayne or should I say Osiris.  My deal and the ideology behind the pyramids and such as well as you &amp; Moses Grandfather God have kept me away from my own nation for many Thousands if not hundreds of thousands of years.  I thought immediately of this movie as I walked around town and such.  I did get some police officers to change something after I had a run in with them.  A small step in police reform, since this is the nation where that was created it was befitting that I get them to make a adjustment.  Anyway Mr. Johnson happy belated birthday."

Many things I didn&#39;t see the first time on the plane, with the little screen staring back at me. Now. At home. Big computer screen and I can see all the things I missed. I can see why many actors are into this idea of how movies are weaker than they used to be. They&#39;re talking about themselves. You know? Movies are getting astronomically more skilled at making impossible realities, come true. Johnson is not a spring chicken, but he pulls a LOT of weight as a fantasy, comic book hero, on screen. And THAT will give an actor confidence. Brosnan and Hodge were really packing it, in &#39;Black Adam.&#39; Everything I heard, about &#39;BA&#39; made me predict a horrible movie, and really happy I was 100 percent off the mark. THIS is an awesome movie. Johnson and Cavill no longer planning any more movies is too bad. But. You can go really far with a dude like Hodge. He&#39;s basically a foundation to build on, if DC wants a quick way to their version of Marvel&#39;s &#39;End Game.&#39; Whoever came up with this &#39;version&#39; of Hawkman is WAY beyond me. Like light years beyond me. And I&#39;m really into comic book worlds. Great job."

And we need more serious movies because DC is supposed to be dark. Really bad story and cast members. Come on DC why is animated movies have better movies than live ones. The only good DC movies were Christopher Nolan movies. I’m a huge DC fan and I’m really disappointed in DC right now

@wolfirene1967,2022-12-24T04:30:21Z,2022-12-24T04:38:56Z,0,"Loved the seriousness of the Rock. Such an underrated actor. This movie did not take the time to develop the other characters except for the clear crushes of our young heroes. Great chemistry.The visuals were amazing! I never read the comic book so have no idea who they all are. Still don&#39;t after watching the movie. I understood who Black Adam was but not the other characters. The one thing I could NOT stand is the soundtrack. Too loud in many places where it should have been soft. What I mean is, sequences that had no REAL action, just characters talking, should not be accompanied by an  &#39;action&#39; soundtrack, especially one heavy with a horn section. A Horn section is serious business and should be saved for a climatic scene. Very bad choice. Good lord, it was distracting. Sound tracks are meant to control the viewer&#39;s emotions and they totally missed the mark. Gone are the years of John Williams and Danny Elfman of my time. However,  this was an improvement over Wonder Woman 1984. The only part I enjoyed of that movie is Gail Gadot, I can&#39;t even imagine another actress doing Wonder Woman ever again, she&#39;s perfect. Dear WB, give Gadot a better script!!"

Everything else is pretty much over produced trash. The CGI is clunky and poorly done in parts, and that&#39;s unforgivable in a modern movie with an approx 200 million dollar budget. The dialogue ranges from witty  to generic predictable super hero ra ra nonsense. The plot is without any original ideas, and the super heroes sent to battle Adam lame all around. The actors themselves all do a decent job with what they are given (fun to see Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Fate) but it can&#39;t save this movie. The Superman cameo at the end was a missed opportunity but now that  Cavill is no longer Superman, they will not be able to follow up with the set up for a battle between them. C-"

Because the swapped out two WHITE CHARACTERS for never been before black representation  characters. The most bogus and pathetic thing you can do. So what your saying is if you do not race swap that no new black characters can be done well? You must ride on the pre- existing history to even generate any interest in a black character. Your a pathetic writer if you can not generate a good story to apply to a black character. So sad , go woke go broke."

Remember that Amer is Palestinian.<br><br>Johnson plays the role of Black Adam. Amon tells Black Adam that ever since his death, his country has been subjected to numerous invaders and oppression. That his people have been waiting for the return of Black Adam.<br><br>In Biblical terms, Jesus is referred to as The New Adam. He is considered the Savior (in Christian culture) who will have a second coming (both in Christian and Islamic cultures). Palestine has been a country invaded by the Greeks, Romans, etc and its people have been subjected to imperialism and oppression. Today, by the Israeli regime, a self-imposed state (not to be confused with the religious or ethnic Jews, though many Jews do live there) which denies Palestinian people freedom, peace, and equal treatment as citizens of the land.<br><br>Awesome symbolism!"

They ordered corona virus and honored in their family name corona siv kobi. They did it in Keansburg city where some of them live by puting a book with notes Kobe, where I rented room. I did not know them before I started renting the room. I discovered later that they are terorists from Russia.  They did these teratcts for stealing cinema companies from my family and also for having restorants Tanuki. They stole digital copy of my body and sell movies by attaching their friends heads to it. They are Samsonovi, Shainurovi, Sivkovi,  Lukini, Zenkovi, Orlovi, Kuznetsovi, Ahmetovi, Ahmatnurovi, Tihkomirovi, Mitini from Perm. Their group  killers, kidnappers, rapers, pedophiles, traffikers, torturers, robbers. They kidnap rich and injure microphones in heads for robbing rich by such torture. This how they do they trafic group. They like to make teracts calling by their names like Siv kobe, tsum nami , me vse, ne pen gon  etc. Who can burry their tero group? One of them came to Japan in Kobe sity and called herself Abby date when she organized nuclear Tsunami terakt there for stealing digital copy of my body from Disney company from pajes of royals who live there . She stole digital copy of my body and attached her head to it. I never gave any right to them to sell digital copy of my body to feed their terorists group. In 2019 she and her friends made virus terakt and they called it Kobe to remind that they did Tsunami nuklear terakt in Kobe. Who can burry all their terorists group members?"

Not feeking the Hawkman casting, mainly because I grew up with a white guy as Hawkman, so seeing this guy in it really sucked until he was a blur in the scenes. The normies consisted of a &#39;stubid&#39; get everyone in trouble character that really makes me wish those scenes were deleted, the other normie pushed the story along, but I feel like they could have put her to greater use. Cinematography was good, the cgi was point, and the fight scenes entertaining. Could have sworn Black Afam was all around bad (sarcasm). Worth watching once, but do it at home were you can save others theater money. It really isn&#39;t worth everyone in your group paying admission when you can all watch a home stream."

Fate was obviously doctor strange, even to the point of splitting himself into loads of himself to fight.

The Rock is a good entertainer and the problem isn&#39;t him. The story is definitely a cross between Superman movie and the Marvel films. They needed to have different hero&#39;s or at least one of the top tier hero&#39;s in this film. And Atom definitely has to go. Once Ant man hit the screen there is no need to see Atom for real. Rock I think you are great entertainer and get back to some comedy that&#39;s your bread and butter. You and Kevin Hart are probably the funniest I&#39;ve watched since Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan or Mike Epps and Ice Cube. Good luck and forget those haters. I&#39;m going to see Black Adam anyway.

Roman 5:19 Says &quot;For as by one man&#39;s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.&quot; Sin entered the world by Adam&#39;s sin and Jesus was considered a second Adam who fixed the problem by his humble sacrifice.

Really the protector, people of Kahndhq were looking upon?? Questions many....<br><br>Analysis of the Movie... <br><br>1) Action, action, action... Dwayne from his fast and furious action had elevated his action in the sky by swriling the baddies up in the air, mercilessly throwing away them like a garbage into the land, with his electrifying hand turns the baddies into a handful of skeleton...Ufffffff it was thunderous....<br><br>2) Action sequences were the main highlight where the hawkman- Adam one on one fights was just goosebumps for me....<br><br>3) Dr Fate, the man who executes his action in his stylish, calm way....<br><br>4) VFX of Hollywood always always fascinates me, as it gives us the manifestation of the unbelievable to be believable...<br><br>&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; Finally the end credits....

Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson is a big man,and the casting for &#39;Superman&#39; needs to be, as well. If Henry Cavill is chosen, then he[ Cavill ] needs to be &quot;buffed-up&quot;. According to the comics, &#39;Superman&#39; is the same height as &#39;Black Adam&#39;. Now, I tolerated when &#39;Warner Bros.&#39; made &#39;Batman&#39; taller, but enough is enough. Also,the FALSE NOTION that &#39;Batman&#39; can beat &#39;Superman&#39; in a fight is foolish in thought. Oh...and Dwayne Johnson can play &#39;Black Adam&#39; considering &#39;Black Adam&#39;s&#39; history of Egyptian Gods. Arabs nor Persians were not of Egypt.

The Wizard Shazam gave Billy Batson his powers and Black Adam is Super Jealous. Black Adam was granted Shazam&#39;s powers first so he feels he should succeed the Wizard Shazam. The wizard saw the evil in him and banished him. Now Black Adam works to destroy Shazam (Billy Batson) every chance he gets."

@themacmozshow107,2022-08-29T17:49:17Z,2022-08-29T17:49:17Z,0,Awful. Bad casting choice (Nothing against the Rock). Just a terrible way to portray a deep and evil character. This will be cataloged as a comedy movie on IMDB. You won&#39;t see Black Adam as a character. You will only see the Rock. Can&#39;t wait to add this to the list of DC movie failures. Stick to writing comics DC. I predict this will be 2 chuckles and a pity laugh out of 10. On a side note: Do you guys think he will drift a car at some point in the movie?

Didn&#39;t they learn from <br>What was presented from <br>Batman Vs Superman <br>Black Adam was supposed to hold on his origin tale here takes part of it and introduces supporting cast characters to flow around the production of the screen time of the movie. <br>Nah either it flops or some good comes out of it.

Have fond memories of watching him wrestling growing up, watching The Rundown, Walking Tall, Scorpion King in theaters at like 11..but enough.<br><br>Looks awful, looks woke, but doesn&#39;t only look awful because of it&#39;s wokeness, just looks unintriguing, feels like something I&#39;ve seen a hundred times in many different films.<br><br>I am not familiar with and have no understanding of &quot;Black Adam,&quot; sounds kinda racially charged. To someone like me it kind of sounds like there&#39;s a religious connotation to the name, which I would find disrespectful to the original tale and dismissive for the superhero character and it&#39;s actor.

What I know is that he only wants to get Shazam because being the Champion is much more powerful than him. The only advantage he has is that he is fighting a Kid who still doesnt know his biggest potential to be the most powerful Shazam. <br><br> So excited to see Shazam Vs Black Adam or<br><br> Shazam and Superman Vs Black Adam<br><br><br>DC fan here

He&#39;s literally the same no matter what character he plays. It&#39;s getting tiresome. He&#39;s a super actor, but... well. <br>Take Christoph Walz, for example. He can play good guys, comedic guys, and villainous guys, fully believable and with the necessary personality and charisma. <br>Rock had some nice acts in the past as well. Faster, for example, he wasn&#39;t a villain in there, but I think he could have been. But 90% of his movies are the same old."

@antondmitrievi4365,2022-07-10T09:38:54Z,2022-07-10T09:38:54Z,0,"The prototype of the character is Black Adam-Kratos. One of the lesser titans, born on Olympus. Helping Zeus in the fight against the titans ... The son of Pallat and Styx (Oceania) whose power passed - so to speak - “by inheritance”. The story tells about the dirty reputation of the aforementioned character of ancient epics and the combustible character of this giant. The film conveys the character of this demigod more in the DC© intro -Black Adam⚡"

@cooldvijay1,2022-07-07T22:23:16Z,2022-07-07T22:23:16Z,0,"The Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) was an ancient Greek war fought between Athens and Sparta and their respective allies for the hegemony of the Greek world. The war remained undecided for a long time until the decisive intervention of the Persian Empire in support of Sparta. Led by Lysander, the Spartan fleet built with Persian subsidies finally defeated Athens and started a period of Spartan hegemony over Greece.<br><br>Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. The first phase (431–421 BC) was named the Ten Years War, or the Archidamian War, after the Spartan king Archidamus II, who launched several invasions of Attica with the full hoplite army of the Peloponnesian League, the alliance network dominated by Sparta. However, the Long Walls of Athens rendered this strategy ineffective, while the superior navy of the Delian League (Athens&#39; alliance) raided the Peloponnesian coast to trigger rebellions within Sparta. The precarious Peace of Nicias was signed in 421 BC and lasted until 413 BC. Several proxy battles took place during this period, notably the battle of Mantinea in 418 BC, won by Sparta against an ad-hoc alliance of Elis, Mantinea (both former Spartan allies), Argos and Athens. The main event was nevertheless the Sicilian Expedition between 415 and 413 BC, during which Athens lost almost all its navy in the attempted capture of Syracuse, an ally in Sparta.<br><br>The Sicilian disaster prompted the third phase of the war (413–404 BC), named the Decelean War, or the Ionian War, when the Persian Empire supported Sparta in order to recover the suzerainty of the Greek cities of Asia Minor, incorporated into the Delian League at the end of the Persian Wars. With Persian money, Sparta built a massive fleet under the leadership of Lysander, who won a streak of decisive victories in the Aegean Sea, notably at Aegospotamos in 405 BC. Athens capitulated the following year and lost all its empire; Lysander imposed puppet oligarchies on the former members of the Delian League, including Athens, where the regime was known as the Thirty Tyrants. The Peloponnesian War was followed ten years later by the Corinthian War (394–386 BC), which, although it ended inconclusively, helped Athens regain its independence from Sparta.<br><br>The Peloponnesian War reshaped the ancient Greek world. On the level of international relations, Athens, the strongest city-state in Greece prior to the war&#39;s beginning, was reduced to a state of near-complete subjection, while Sparta became established as the leading power of Greece. The economic costs of the war were felt all across Greece; poverty became widespread in the Peloponnese, while Athens was completely devastated, and never regained its pre-war prosperity.[2][3] The war also wrought subtler changes to Greek society; the conflict between democratic Athens and oligarchic Sparta, each of which supported friendly political factions within other states, made war a common occurrence in the Greek world. Ancient Greek warfare, meanwhile, originally a limited and formalized form of conflict, was transformed into an all-out struggle between city-states, complete with atrocities on a large scale. Shattering religious and cultural taboos, devastating vast swathes of countryside, and destroying whole cities, the Peloponnesian War marked the dramatic end to the fifth century BC and the golden age of Greece.[4]<br><br><br><br><br><br>NAME OF THE MOVIE-----------300 Rising Above The Peloponnesian war alliances<br><br>TITLE OF THE MOVIE----------300 Rising Above The Peloponnesian war alliances<br><br><br><br><br><br>Date	431 – April 25, 404 BC<br><br>Location	<br>Mainland Greece, Asia Minor, Sicily<br><br>Commanders and leaders<br>Pericles (died in 429 BC)<br>Cleon †<br>Nicias Executed<br>Alcibiades Executed (in exile)<br>Demosthenes Executed	Archidamus II<br>Brasidas †<br>Lysander<br>Alcibiades Executed (in exile)<br><br><br><br><br><br>Budget------------$179 million<br><br>Box office--------$786 million<br><br><br><br><br><br>MYNAMEISCR7RONALDOANDIAMTHEDEATHCOMPANYORIGIN AND WEAREPRODUCINGTHISFILMTITLEORMOVIETITLE ANDBYDOINGSO WEAREOFFICIALLY MAKINGITADEATHCOMPANYMOVIE<br>IWANT20%CREDITSFORTHISGHOSTWRITERTITLEORMOVIEIREPEAT20%CREDITSFORTHISGHOSTWRITERTITLEORMOVIE<br><br><br><br><br><br>NAME OF THE MOVIE-----------300 Rising Above The Peloponnesian war alliances<br><br>TITLE OF THE MOVIE----------300 Rising Above The Peloponnesian war alliances<br><br><br><br><br><br>THISSCRIPTISNOWCOMPLETELYATMOSPHERICDonE......TRUEDAT.........A L W A Y S"

@LordZandersSoapbox4811,2022-06-24T11:05:18Z,2022-06-24T11:05:18Z,2,"This isn’t Black Adam, it’s a revisionist fan fiction.  In the DC Comic books, Black Adam is one of the most powerful supervillains in the Universe. He’s not the Anti-Villain, living to avenge his son, shown in this trailer. In the comics he has murdered family, even children, to gain power. As a fan of DC comic books, when all is said and done, he only cares about power. I accept the fact that WB is not making these movies for me but for the “normies” and consumer fans of the DCEU."

@alpal482,2022-06-24T07:09:10Z,2022-06-24T07:09:10Z,0,His only vulnerability is criticism on Twitter. I’m so excited for this turncoat to play a badass who takes no nonsense...except when Twitter babies point out old comments from 10+ plus years ago and he crumbles to the floor and apologises. I wonder if John Cena will replace him in the sequels?
@gngrdanny,2022-06-24T06:16:58Z,2022-06-24T06:16:58Z,0,Would it have been a bit on the nose to recast black Adam as a black dude?

Black Adam is one of the most evil and narcissistic villains in DC. And no doubt the Rock will do as the Rock does, but this is getting silly at this point."
